<header> <h1>Preparation</h1></header><h4>
First rinse and shred the cabbage and french beans.<br> 
Wipe the mushrooms with a wet cloth and then slice them. <br>You can also rinse the mushrooms in fresh water if you prefer.
Rinse, peel and grate the carrots. Chop the onions, ginger, celery and garlic.<br></h4>
<h1>Stir Frying Veggies</h1><h4>
Heat oil in a pan or wok.<br>
Add finely chopped onions, ginger and garlic. Stir and saute on a medium heat for 2 minutes.<br>
Then add the finely chopped french beans. Stir and add the sliced mushrooms.<br>
On a medium to high heat, stir fry till the mushrooms get lightly browned from the edges.<br>
Meanwhile make a paste of corn starch and water. Keep aside.<br>
Once the mushrooms are lightly browned (takes about 5 to 6 minutes on a medium to high heat) add carrots, cabbage and celery.<br>
Stir fry these veggies on a high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.<br></h4><h1>
Making Hot And Sour Soup</h1><h4>
Add water or veg stock. Stir well. Add soy sauce and stir.<br>
Then season with salt.<br> 
Keep a check on the amount of salt as soy sauce already has salt.<br>
Bring the soup to a simmer on medium heat.<br>
Stir the cornstarch paste and add it to the soup. Stir and mix again very well.<br>
Allow the soup to thicken on a low to medium heat.<br>
When the hot and sour soup has thickened, add black pepper or white pepper and vinegar.<br>
Give a final stir. Switch off the heat. Check the taste and add more soy sauce, vinegar or salt or black pepper if needed.<br>
Serve the hot and sour soup steaming hot garnished with coriander leaves (cilantro) or spring onion greens.<br>
You can also just add the cilantro towards the end and then serve the soup.<br></h4>
