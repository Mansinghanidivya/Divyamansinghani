Preparation</h1><h4>
Cooking Chickpeas<br>
Firstly, rinse the chickpeas a few times in water.<br> Soak the dried chickpeas overnight in water or for 8 to 9 hours.<br>
Drain all the water and rinse the chickpeas again once or twice.<br> Again drain the water and set aside.<br>
Now you can cook the chickpeas in a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker or Instant pot.<br>
Add the soaked chickpeas, cinnamon, black cardamoms, cloves, tej patta, crushed ginger, dried gooseberry pieces, black salt or regular salt in the stovetop pressure cooker or in the steel insert of the Instant pot.<br>
If you do not have dried gooseberry, then opt to use 1 tea bag or 1 teaspoon black tea powder or black tea leaves tightly wrapped in a muslin.<br>
Add 3 cups water and give a stir.<br>
For stovetop pressure cooker, cook the chickpeas on medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes or more if required.<br>
For instant pot, pressure cook on high pressure mode for 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
Whether you have cooked the chickpeas in the stovetop pressure cooker or Instant pot, wait for all the pressure to fall naturally. <br>Then only remove the lid.<br>
The chickpeas have to be tender with a melt in the mouth texture.<br>
Strain the chickpeas and reserve 1 cup stock together with the whole spices if you have used dried gooseberry.<br> If you have used tea leaves or tea powder, then discard the stock.<br></h4>
