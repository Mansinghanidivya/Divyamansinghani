<h1>Cooking Noodles:</h1><h4>
First boil water in a pan with salt and oil.<br>
Add noodles to the boiling water and cook them till they are just cooked or al dente.<br>
While noodles are cooking, rinse and chop the vegetables.<br>
Once noodles are cooked al dente, drain them in a colander or sieve.<br>
Then rinse noodles in fresh water by placing the colander or sieve under fresh tap water.<br>
Drain all the water and set aside.<br></h4><p>
<h1>Making Veg Noodles</h1><h4></p>
Heat oil in a wok or pan.<br>
First add the garlic and ginger and stir fry or sauté on low to medium-low heat for some seconds.<br>
Increase the heat to a high and add the chopped spring onions.<br>
Keep on stirring continuously and stir fry the onions till they become translucent.<br>
Add the veggies – carrots, capsicum and french beans.<br>
Continue to toss and stir fry on a high flame till the veggies are almost cooked.<br>
Use a pan with handles as its better to lift it while tossing.<br>
You can also decrease the flame if the heat becomes too much too handle and then stir fry the veggies on a medium flame.<br>
Some crunch should be there in the vegetables, so don’t cook the vegetables till they become completely soft.<br>
Add the soy sauce, celery, salt and pepper. Mix well.<br>
Add cooked noodles. Keep on tossing and stirring till the veggies are mixed well with noodles for a minute or two. Switch off the heat.<br>
Check the taste and add more salt, black pepper or soy sauce if required to the stir-fried veg noodles.</i>
