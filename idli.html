<h4><i><br>Soaking Rice And Lentils
<br>Pick and rinse both the regular rice and parboiled rice.
<br>Rinse the poha and add to the rice.
<br>Add water. Mix well. Cover and keep the rice + poha to soak for 4 to 5 hours.
<br>In a separate bowl, rinse the urad dal and methi seeds a couple of times.
<br>Soak the urad dal with methi seeds separately in water for 4 to 5 hours.</h4><p><h1>
Making Idli Batter</p></h1><h4>

Drain the soaked urad dal. Reserve the water.<br>
Grind the urad dal, methi seed with ¼ cup of the reserved water for some seconds.<br> Then add remaining ¼ cup water. Grind till you get a smooth and fluffy batter.<br>
Remove the urad dal batter in a bowl and keep aside.<br>
Grind the rice in batches to make a smooth batter.<br>
Mix both the batters together in a large bowl or pan. Add salt and mix well.<br>
<br>Cover and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more if required.
After the fermentation process is over, the idli batter will become double in size and rise.</h4><p><h1>
Steaming Idli</p></h1><h4>
Grease the idli moulds.<br>
Pour the batter in the moulds and steam the idli in a pressure cooker or steamer.<br>
If using pressure cooker remove the vent weight (whistle).<br>
Steam for 12 to 15 mins or until the idli is done.<br>
Serve the steaming hot idli with coconut chutney and sambar.<br>
