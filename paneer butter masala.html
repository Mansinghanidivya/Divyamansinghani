    <h1>  How to Make Paneer Butter Masala</h1>
<br>You will have to do some light prep work before you begin making this delicious recipe. 
<br>It starts with soaking your cashews, making tomato puree and blending soaked cashews.

<h2>Preparation</h2>
 <h4>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes
 <br>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients.
 <br>It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, 
 and slicing paneer into cubes.
 <br>  make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to 
 medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. 
 <br>Keep aside.
<br> Note: Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.
<br>After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to
 a blender or mixer-grinder.

<br>Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).
    <br>	Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews.
	<br> Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.
 <br>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.

Note: There’s no need to blanch the tomatoes or 
to wash the blender pitcher before blending.

<br>chopped tomatoes added in the same blender jar
 <br>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.

<br>Note: Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.

    <br>Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low.

<br>Tip: Alternatively, you can add 1 tablespoon oil + 1-2 tablespoons of butter to the pan.
<br> Adding oil prevents the butter from browning too quickly.
    <br>Keep the the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, 
	<br>or until fragrant.
    <br> Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.
   .<br> Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.
    <br>Pour in the prepared tomato purée.
<br>Note: Be careful while adding the purée as it may splutter.
    <br>  Next add kashmiri red chili powder and stir again.
	<br>  Continue to sauté till the oil starts to leave the sides of the tomato paste.
<br>The tomato paste will thicken considerably and will start
 <br>coming together as one whole lump. 
<br>Then add cashew paste and stir well.
 <br>Sauté the cashew paste for a few minutes till the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala paste.
<br>The cashew paste will begin to cook fast.
