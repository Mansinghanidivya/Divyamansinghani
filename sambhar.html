<h4><i><br>
Soak the tamarind in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. 
<br>Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.
Cooking Lentils<br>
Rinse tuvar dal a couple of times in water.<br>
Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.<br>
Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix. <br>Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.<br>
When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal.<br> The dal should be completely cooked and mushy.<br>
Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk.<br> Cover and keep aside. You can see the consistency of dal in the pic below.<br><p></h4>
<h1>Cooking Vegetables</h1> </p> <h4>
When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables.<br>
Take the chopped vegetables in a pan or pot.<br> Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).<br>
Sprinkle turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.<br> Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. <br>
Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir.<br>
Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium flame.<br> In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.<br>
Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t over cook the vegetables.<br></h4><h1><p>
Making Sambar</h1><h4></p>
Once the vegetables are almost cooked, then add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.5 tablespoons sambar powder. Mix well.<br>
Add the mashed dal. Mix again very well.<br>
Simmer on a medium-low heat till the sambar comes to a boil. <br>
You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling. At this step switch off the heat. Cover and set aside.<br></h4><h1><p>
Tempering</h1></p><h4>
<br>In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds.
<br>Let the mustard seeds crackle.
<br>Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).
<br>Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) and 2 pinches of asafoetida (hing).<br> Be careful as the oil splutters while adding curry leaves.
<br>Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp.
<br>Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.
<br>Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture gets infused with the sambar.
<br>Serve sambar hot. You can garnish it with a few coriander leaves if you prefer.<br> It can also be served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.
