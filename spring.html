First cook noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.
<br>Once the noodles are cooked al dente, then drain the water from the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.
<br>Drain any water and set aside.
<br>Chop the veggies in thin long strips or matchsticks. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper
 (capsicum) in thin strips or matchsticks. For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. 
 <br>Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.
<br>Please note you can use your choice of veggies.
Making Stuffing
<br>Now heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.
<br>Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.
<br>Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too 
<br>high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fry
<br>Add crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.
<br>Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.
<br>Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.
Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
<br>Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.
Preparing Sealing Paste
<br>In a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.
Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.
<br>Stuffing Spring Rolls<br>
<br>Now take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, 
then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.
<br>Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. 
Then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing.
<br>Wrapping Method 1
<br>Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.
<br>Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.
<br>Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
<br>If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.
Wrapping Method 2
<br>Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.
Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.
<br>Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it. 
While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break.
 <br>If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.
Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. 
<br>Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.
<br>Deep Frying Veg Spring Rolls
<br>Heat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).
<br>Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.
<br>Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.
<br>Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.
<br>Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.
<br>Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.
<br>Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches.
<br>Garnish veg spring rolls with some chopped spring onion greens or coriander leaves (cilantro) 
<br>if you like. Serve fried spring rolls hot with any dipping sauce of your choice like chili garlic sauce, hoisin sauce or tomato ketchup.
