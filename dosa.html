<h4><i><br>Soaking Lentils And Rice
<br>In a bowl take the idli rice or parboiled rice along with the regular white rice. 
<br>Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I have shown in the video. 
<br>The video has the recipe ingredients doubled in proportion.
<br>To the same bowl, add urad dal and fenugreek seeds.
<br>Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep aside.
<br>In a separate bowl, take the flattened rice.
<br>Rinse it once or twice in water and then add rinsed flattened rice to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi seeds.
<br>Pour 1.5 cups water. Mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 5 to 6 hours.</h4>

Making Dosa Batter</h1></p><h4>
<br>Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients in a wet grinder jar.
<br>Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of batter is also fine. 
<br>If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again.
<br>Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches.
 <br>I ground in two batches and added overall ¾ cup water.
<br>Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan.
<br>Add ½ tsp rock salt. Mix very well. Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. 
<br>Time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions.
<br>A proper fermentation will double or triple up the volume of the batter and you will see tiny air pockets in the batter with a light sour aroma.
<br>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.<p> </h4><h1>
Making Dosa</h1> </p><h4>
<br>Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan.
 <br>Do keep the heat on low to low-medium heat, so that you are easily able to spread the batter.
 <br>If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium.
<br>Do not spread oil if you are using a non stick pan, as you won’t be able to spread the batter.
<br>Now take a ladle full of the batter.
 <br>Pour the dosa batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards.
<br>Cover it with a lid and cook the dosa on a low to medium heat.
 <br>Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness.
<br>When you see the batter on the top has cooked well and the bottom has become crisp and golden, then sprinkle ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil on the edges and center.
<br>With the spoon spread the oil on the dosa.
<br>Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp.
 <br>The base will leave the pan and the sides will also get separated when it gets cooked.
<br>Fold and serve sada dosa hot. Make all dosai this way.<br>
Serve these crisp plain dosa with sambar or potato masala or coconut chutney.
