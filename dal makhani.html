Preparation</h1>
<h4> <i> <br>
Soak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight.<br> Later drain them well.
<br>Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.
Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker.<br> Add water and stir well.<br>
<br>Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.
<br>The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. <br>You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.
<br>In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. <br>Set aside.<br>
<br>You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. <br>No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.
Making Dal Makhani<br>
<br>In a pan, now heat butter. You can use salted butter or unsalted butter.
<br>Add the whole spices – cumin seeds, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon, 1 small to medium tej patta.
<br>Fry for some seconds till the spices sputter and become aromatic.
<br>Add finely chopped onions.
<br>Stir and sauté the onions on a low or medium-low heat often till they become light golden.
<br>Add the ginger garlic paste. Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
<br>Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.
<br>Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.
<br> Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.
<br>Stir very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.
<br>Then add the cooked urad dal and rajma beans along with the stock.<br>Also add 1 cup water or as required.
Slow Cooking
<br>Stir very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low flame.<br>
<br>Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don’t stuck to the bottom of the pan.
<br>Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.
<br>Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low flame. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmered on low heat.
<br>When simmering you can add more water if the gravy looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.
<br>I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low flame. Do keep on stirring at intervals.
<br>When the gravy has thickened enough, then add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.
<br>Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.
<br>Add crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix again.
<br>Cover and set dal makhani aside, if you are proceeding to the dhungar method. Or else you can serve dal makhni straight away.
<br>Dhungar Method
<br>Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes red hot. With the help of tongs, keep on turning the charcoal piece so that it evenly burns.
<br>Keep the red hot charcoal in a small bowl.
<br>Pour ½ teaspoon oil on the hot charcoal.
<br>Immediately keep this bowl on top of the dal makhani.
<br>Cover for a minute and allow the charcoal to infuse its smoke in the dal makhni. Remove the bowl. Stir again.
<br>Serve punjabi dal makhani garnished with chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and a few teaspoons of cream with naan, roti, paratha or steamed rice.
